*Figure: The total weights of the patch embedding layers in a Minape with a patch of 8 are visualized. While these layers essentially act as crude edge detectors, the industrial nature of the Mudestreda dataset prevents any discernible patterns from emerging. Interestingly, a number of filters bear a striking resemblance to noise, indicating the potential requirement for increased regularization.*
